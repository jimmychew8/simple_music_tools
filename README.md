# simple_music_tools
I'll be adding some very simple 'calculator' type programs to help out with music composing in python 2.7.

1) Bar count gives you the amount of music in time (in seconds) you have written given the bar and time signature. 

2) Rhythm cycle simulator that displays any number of cycles of n length.
