# simple_music_tools
Some simple programs to help out with music calculations that may or may not be useful for writing music. The programs are written in Python 2.7.

Here's an overview of the programs:

1) Bar count tool (calculates time of music written given the bar and the tempo)

2) Loop simulator tool (indicates how m loops of length n will overlap)

3) Metric modulation tool (given a metric modulation, calculates the new tempo in bpm's)

4) Metric modulation calculator (given two bpm's, returns possible modulation schemes)

5) Canon simulator (for unison canons, no transpositions)

6) Canon interval calculator (gives you intervals between unison canons offset by a certain interval)

7) Composite rhythm calculator (given m loops of length n gives you profile of the composite rhythm)
