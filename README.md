# simple_music_tools
Some simple programs to help out with music calculations that may or may not be useful for writing music. The programs are written in Python 2.7.

Here's an overview of the programs:

1) Bar count tool (calculates time of music written given the bar and the tempo)

2) Loop simulator tool (indicates how m number of loops of length n will overlap in a time signature)

3) Metric modulation tool (given a metric modulation, calculates the new tempo in bpm's)

4) Metric modulation calculator (given two bpm's, returns possible modulation schemes)

5) Canon simulator (simulates unison canons)

6) Canon interval calculator (calculates intervals between unison canons)

7) Composite rhythm calculator (shows profile of the composite rhythm made out of m number of loops of length n)
